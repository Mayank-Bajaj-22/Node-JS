Introduction to Node.js
    • Open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime.
    • Allows you to run JavaScript on your machine or servers.
    • Built on the V8 JavaScript engine for speed.
    • Robust ecosystem with npm.

Open Source??
    Open-source means that the source code of Node.js is
    publicly available.

    Anyone can:
        • View: You can see how Node.js is built under the hood.
        • Modify: If you want to customize or improve Node.js, you can do it.
        • Contribute: Developers around the world actively contribute to improving Node.js.

Cross-Platform??
    Cross-platform means Node.js can run on multiple operating systems without needing major changes.

    Supported platforms:
        • Windows
        • macOS
        • linux

JavaScript Runtime Environment??
    JavaScript runtime environment refers to the environment where your JavaScript code runs.

    In browsers: JavaScript typically runs in the browser (like Chrome or Firefox) to handle frontend tasks.

    With Node.js:
        Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, on the server.
        It provides tools to interact with the system, like:

            • File system (read/write files).
            • Network (handle HTTP requests).
            • Database (connect to databases like MongoDB or MySQL).


Why is Node.js Special as a Runtime?

    V8 Engine:
        Node.js uses Google Chrome's V8 engine to compile JavaScript into machine code, making it lightning-fast.

    Built-in APIs:
        Node.js comes with built-in APIs (like fs for file systems or http for servers) so you can build powerful applications without extra libraries.


Why Do We Need Node.js?
    Single Language for Full Stack Development:
        ▪ Developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, reducing complexity.
        ▪ For example, a MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

    High Performance:
        ▪ Thanks to the V8 engine, Node.js is super fast.
        ▪ It can handle thousands of simultaneous connections with ease.

    Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O:
        ▪ Unlike traditional servers that block a thread for each request, Node.js uses an
        asynchronous model, making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks.

    Scalable for Modern Applications:
        Ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, streaming platforms, or online games.


Where Is Node.js Used?
    Examples of Companies Using Node.js:

        • Netflix: To deliver faster streaming experiences.
        • LinkedIn: Their backend uses Node.js to handle massive amounts of data.
        • PayPal: To handle secure transactions and ensure scalability.
        • Uber: For real-time driver and rider data syncing.
        • Trello: For managing asynchronous updates in real-time boards.


Is it a Language or a Framework?
    Node.js is not a programming language or a framework, but rather a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript outside of a browser.
